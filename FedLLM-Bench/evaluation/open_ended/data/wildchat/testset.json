A research paper titled\"Multibin Breathing Pattern Estimation by Radar Fusion for Enhanced Driver Monitoring,\" was published by Dr. George Shaker, an assistant professor, as well as his team of graduate students from the University of Waterloo. Inspired by the medical bay of the USS Enterprise from \"Star Trek,\" the research team demonstrates the potential of radar technology to transform ordinary vehicles into mobile medical center and highlights the use of radar to monitor drivers' health status while driving by collecting health data for precise analysis and treatment in advance.\n\n2. The radar, like a small USB drive, is put inside a car. It sends signals to detect people's vibrations and sends the signals back. The built-in AI system collects and analyzes the data to create a medical image and find any possible health issues. After driving, the system sends the report to the driver's phone for review. \"Radar technology is not new,\" Shaker explained. \"We first used it in 2017 for touch-less car controls and to alert people about children and pets left in cars. Now, we are using it to check the health of car passengers. This is part of our plan to make cars into medical centers in the future.\"This latest technology from Waterloo aimed at disrupting the boundaries of  drivers’ health by detecting tiny changeable movements, like breathing or heartbeats, which is a step towards achieving our vision of cars as medical center of the future.\n\n3.  For Shaker and his team, the challenge was evolving the tech to identify changes in breathing patterns or heart rhythms that signify potential health issues related to respiratory system and cardiovascular conditions. “We are committed to getting exact information about people's respiratory and heart systems and teaching the AI to interpret the medical data professionally and precisely. Besides, people's privacy and security are inaccessible except the monitored person’s cellphone only.\n4.  A series of tests using synthetic data testified the system's capability to accurately detect and interpret respiratory conditions by randomly selected test-takers holding breath and taking shallow breaths. The system has also been tested and proven successful on individuals with heart conditions.The research team is enhancing the radar technology to monitor the health and well-being of all vehicle occupants, conduct diagnostics, generate detailed medical reports that flag any issues that need attention, and assist with emergency communication during accidents.\n",
