In the traditional paradigm, the models are pretrained on custom domain corpus and finetuned on specific tasks, which make them very expensive for gpus and workers. What is worse, recent trends in language modeling is focusing on increasing performance through scaling with a booming cost.\n\nWe propose a simple and efficient pretraining framework GUR that unifies the language modeling and contrastive learning tasks in one pretraining step. Based on the examples of similar text pairs chosen by their LCS (longest common string) from raw unlabeled documents, our pretraining scheme consists of masked language modeling combined with a unsupervised contrastive learning task. The resulting model GUR performs surprisingly well without any labeled training datapoints. Specifically, it significantly outperforms all other pretrained baselines as a retriever at the recall benchmark in a zero-shot setting, and is competitive with BM25, a strong sparse baseline. Of course, the GUR keeps the ability of language modeling in our ablation experiment.\n\n"

If 36 of them didn't get picked for the team and the rest were put into 4 groups, how many students would be in each group?\nReasoning: The number of students who got picked for the team is 64 - 36 = 28. To find how many students would be in each group, we need to divide the number of students by the number of groups, which is 28 / 4 = 7. Therefore, there will be 7 students in each group. \nAnswer: 7\n\nQuestion: Cody bought 7 boxes of chocolate candy and 3 boxes of caramel candy. If each box has 8 pieces inside it, how much candy did he have total?\nReasoning: First, we need to find the total number of boxes Cody bought, which is 7 + 3 = 10 boxes. Then, we can multiply the number of boxes by the number of pieces of candy in each box to find the total amount of candy. Therefore, Cody had 10 x 8 = 80 pieces of candy in total.\nAnswer: 80\n\nQuestion: For Halloween Robin scored 23 pieces of candy. She ate 7 pieces the first night and then her sister gave her 21 more pieces. How many pieces of candy does Robin have now?\nReasoning: We need to add the number of pieces of candy she had after the first night to the number of pieces her sister gave her. Therefore, the total number of pieces of candy Robin has now is 23 - 7 + 21 = 37.\nAnswer: 37"
